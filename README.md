## General Information

Find Your Hat is a terminal game that requires you to maneuver across the field (covered with safe areas and holes) to find your lost hat. The goal of the game is to find your hat without falling into one of the holes.

## Features

- Randomly generates a field based on height and width provided along with the maximum percentage of the field that will comprise holes.
- Accepts case insensitive user input (U, D, L, or R) to maneuver across the field.
- Ends the game when the user finds the hat, falls into a hole, or steps out-of-bounds.

## Project Status

The project is materially complete although small altercations may be made as potential improvements are identified and as my learning progresses.

## Room for Improvement

- Hole generation that is consistent and responsive to generate fields that are winnable. Hole generation is primarily random (with some restrictions), which may result in fields that are deemed unwinnable.

## Acknowledgment

The Find Your Hat (terminal game) is based on a project provided by Codecademy's full stack web development curriculum.
